# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis - Power BI

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to **analyze the reasons behind customer churn** for a fictional telecom company called **Databel**, and identify the key factors influencing customer decisions. Based on the findings, actionable recommendations were developed to help the company:
- Reduce churn rate
- Improve customer experience
- Increase customer retention

---

## 📚 Project Context
This project is part of the **Power BI for Data Analyst** career track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).  
After completing the first 4 courses in the track, I applied the knowledge gained to this hands-on case study.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Databel Telecom Dataset (DataCamp)
- **Number of records:** 6687 customers
- **Number of columns:** 29
- **Key fields:**
  - `Customer_id`: Unique customer identifier
  - `Churn Label`: Indicates if the customer has churned (Yes/No)
  - `Age`: Customer age
  - `Contract Type`: Contract type (Monthly/Yearly)
  - `Unlimited Data Plan`: Whether the customer has an unlimited data plan
  - `International Plan`: International calls plan
  - `Customer Service Calls`: Number of customer service calls
  - `Monthly Charges`: Monthly subscription cost
  - `Total Charges`: Total payments made

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Churn Rate = 26.86%** (1796 customers out of 6687)
- Monthly contracts account for **more than half of churn cases**
- Customers aged **60+** show higher churn rates than average
- **Competitors’ offers** are the top reason for churn (30%+)

---

## 🔎 Key Insights
1. **Short-term contracts (month-to-month)** have significantly higher churn rates than long-term contracts.  
2. **Age is a factor** → customers over 60 years old are more likely to churn.  
3. **Customer support**: Customers who contacted support multiple times had higher churn, indicating service quality issues.  
4. **Additional plans & fees**: Customers with extra charges (data or international calls) were more likely to churn.  
5. **Competition**: The primary churn driver is stronger offers from competitors.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Loyalty Programs**: Offer discounts or special deals for senior customers.  
- **Encourage long-term contracts**: Provide incentives or perks for yearly subscriptions.  
- **Improve customer support**: Actively follow up with customers who reach out multiple times.  
- **Fee transparency**: Clarify additional charges and notify customers about usage limits.  
- **Competitive offers**: Create flexible, value-driven plans to counter competition.
